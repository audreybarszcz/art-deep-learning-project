## Goal
This project aims to predict whether two artworks are by the same artist or not using a neural network.

Same artist (Matisse):

Different artists (Seurat & Signac):

## About the dataset
The dataset includes 103,250 unique images of artworks by 1659 different artists, with up to 500 works per artist.

For this project, however, a subset of artists were chosen to train and test on.

## Data Preprocessing
All images used for this task were resized to 224x224.

## Model
A MobileNetV3-small pretrained network is used for this project. The final two linear layers are re-trained for this particular task.
